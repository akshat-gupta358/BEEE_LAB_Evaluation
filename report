EXPERIMENT 

	
	THEORY: 
	As per the circuit diagram, we have made a system of automatically rings a bell whenever someone enters a temple. The PIR sensor feed to
	the analog pin of the Arduino. 
	The analog Pin senses the voltage and gives some analog value to Arduino. The analog value changes according to the motion of PIR sensor.
	So, as the sensor feels some motion then the bell rings.
	
	
	
	
	LEARNING AND OBSERVATIONS:
	As per the Arduino code, if the analog value falls below 1000 we consider it as stationary state. If the value comes above 1000 
	we consider it as rings of the bell. 
	
	
	PROBLEMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING: 
	You should take care whether the board in the Arduino\UNO or not and also selection of port in tools. This is the main problem where we
	get confusion 
	
	PRECAUTIONS: 
	While installing bell in Arduino we should take care whether the ’n’ terminals of sensor is connected or not. Here the ‘n’ terminals 
	should be connected similarly, we should check whether the ‘p’ terminals are connected or not.In this case ‘p’ terminals should not be
	connected. 
	Install the wires properly in both bread board and arduino board.  
	
	LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
	With this experiment we can learn that how bell rings when the PIR sensor is connected to the bell and detects the motion of people when they enters the temple.
